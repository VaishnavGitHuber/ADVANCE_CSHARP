# Asynchronous Programming Overview

1. **Asynchronous programming** allows tasks to run independently without blocking the main thread.  
2. It enables executing multiple instructions at the same time for better performance.  
3. The **`async`** keyword defines a method that can run asynchronously.  
4. The **`await`** keyword pauses the async method until the awaited task is complete.  
5. Code runs synchronously until it reaches an **`await`**, after which it continues asynchronously.
